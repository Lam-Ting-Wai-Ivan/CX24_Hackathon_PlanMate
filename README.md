# Cathay Pacific 24 Hackathon PlanMate
This is the repository for uploading my work during 2024 Cathay Pacific Hackathon

In this project, we used few-shot prompting to ensure the LLM give the correct output
Users can upload travel-related articles, draft itineraries, or planning documents (e.g., budget breakdowns, group size, trip duration) to the RAG-enabled storage bucket. The AI leverages this context to generate personalized recommendations, ensuring responses are tailored to their unique travel goals and constraints.
